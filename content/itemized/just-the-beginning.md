My life is at an interesting point right now. I am unemployed and I am essentially homeless. Most of my belongings have been packed up and hidden away – maybe for a year or two or more. It’s very exciting to be starting on this trip. Michael and I have been planning it for years and it’s hard to believe that it has finally come together. Here are some of the preparations we made before leaving the country.

**1. Checked Visa requirements.** Foreigners need a Visa before entering Brazil. Luckily, Brazil is offering a special free Visa for World Cup ticket holders.

**2. Found the cheapest round-trip flight between Atlanta and Brazil.** We booked our flight for 60,000 SkyMiles plus $56.15.

**3. Kept tabs on the World Cup ticket releases.** We applied at every round of ticket releases and ended up winning tickets for the group matches USA vs Ghana, Japan vs Greece, and USA vs Germany.

**3. Got lots of shots.** We got vaccines for Yellow Fever, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, DTAP booster, and Rabies. Am I invincible now?

**4. Checked foreign transaction fees on debit cards.** I opened a checking account with Charles Schwab to get their international fee-free debit ATM card with no foreign transaction fees on purchases. My Delta American Express Platinum card also offers no foreign transaction fees on purchases. *Update 9/28/2014 When I landed in Brazil, I only used my debit card once at an airport ATM before it got cancelled because of possible skimming... so Michael made all the withdrawals for the rest of the trip... until his debit card got cancelled a month later...*

**5. Changed phone service.** I ported my current phone number to Google Voice to keep the number throughout my travels and when I return. *Update 9/28/2014 Sounds like Google is about to eliminate the Google Voice product. Not sure yet what that means for my phone number.*

**6. Made plans for a couple of days.** We booked a hostel stay for the first two days in Brazil and then we'll figure out the rest when we get down there.

**7. Packed light.** The total weight of my belongings is around 30lbs. *Update 7/13/2014  after walking around all day with my pack, I feel like I did not pack light enough. I’m contemplating what I can abandon right now… shirts, shoes, or my disco ball light bulb?*


Bye for now,

Keri
